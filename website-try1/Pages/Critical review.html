  <h2>The Firemen's Ball (Hori ma panenko) (1967)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Milos Forman</h3>
  <p>To launch the PG Film Club, there will be a screening of Miloš Forman’s film ‘The Firemen's Ball' (Hori ma panenko) - "The last, best and funniest movie Miloš Forman would make in his native Czechoslovakia.” Accompanying this, will be the documentary ‘Kids’, about the 1960s directors of the Czech New Wave, and produced at FAMU (Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague).</p>

  <h2>Beautiful Girls (1996)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Ted Demme</h3>
  <p>Willie (Timothy Hutton) is at a crossroads with big decisions to make in both his personal and professional life. During this time he returns home for his high school reunion where he meets old and new friends, all with their own problems in life, as he tries to make up his mind about his future.</p>

  <h2>South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Trey Parker</h3>
  <p>is an animated musical-comedy that serves as a prudent case study for discussions surrounding film censorship, taste and the impact of media on children that are as relevant now as they were in 1999.
  Synopsis:
  Inspired by Les Miserables, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Monty Python, this musical motion picture adaptation of the hit TV show South Parksees childhood friends Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneak into an R-rated film starring Canadian television personalities Terrance and Phillip. The boys and their fellow classmates emerge from the experience with expanded vocabularies that leave parents and teachers outraged. When the USA tries to censor the film, the resultant controversy becomes a call to war with Canada!
  </p>

  <h2>Cache (Hidden) (2005)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Michael Haneke</h3>
  <p>is a psychological thriller written and directed by Michael Haneke, starring Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche. The plot follows an upper-class French couple, Georges and Anne, who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance. Clues in the videos point to Georges' childhood memories, and his resistance to his parents' adopting an Algerian orphan named Majid, who was sent away. The tapes lead him to the now-grown Majid.
  The film has been interpreted as an allegory about collective guilt and collective memory, and as a statement on France's Algerian War and the French government’s subsequent denial of colonial crimes. The film is also an exploration of the psychological effects of paranoia in a contemporary surveillance society and the trauma of the dispossessed and silenced minorities in a postcolonial state. One of the most notable formal features of the film is its carefully paced montage, which leads to what arguably is one of the most shocking scenes in contemporary cinema history.</p>

  <h2>Oldboy (2003)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Park Chan-Wook</h3>
  <p>is a 2003 Korean vengeance thriller and the fourth feature film by Korean director Park Chan-Wook. At the time of its release, it was highly acclaimed, winning numerous awards in South Korea and Asia as well as the Grand Prix at the 2004 edition of the Cannes film festival. The film is the second instalment of Park Chan-Wook’s ‘Vengeance trilogy’ (sandwiched between Sympathy for Mr Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005)), three narratively unconnected films that are thematically connected by the a preoccupation with vengeance and its dehumanising effects on its protagonists, punctuated by stylised violence and black comedy.</p>

  <h2>Rams (2015)</h2>
  <h3>Dir. Grimur Hakonarson</h3>
  <p>In Grimur Hakonarson’s Rams, two lumbering, middle-aged brothers, Gummi (Sigurdur Sigurjonsson) and Kiddi (Theoder Juliusson), tend sheep in a remote valley. The animals are of the same ancestral stock their family has reared for aeons, and while the men haven’t spoken to each other for 40 years, thanks to an amusingly unspecified grudge, for the most part they rub along, passing handwritten notes via a helpful sheepdog when a grunt or a glower won’t suffice.
  With their thick jumpers and tangled beards, they and their animals might be knitted from the same stuff. It’s the present, but this existence, passed from one generation to the next, has the hewn-granite texture of myth.</p>

  <h2>300 Miles to Heaven (1989)</h2>
  h3>Dir. Maciej Dejczer</h3>
  <p>One of the most controversial films of 80’s Polish cinema was hidden from the public from many years. Almost as a manifesto, the film predicts a butterfly effect of socialism and the Fall of the Berlin Wall on a Polish Millennial from Generation Y. The story is similar to the myth of Daedalus and Icarus and explores the idea of freedom and its consequences while simultaneously dealing with a subject of emigration and belonging.
  The film is based on a true story dating back to 1985 when two Polish boys, a teenager and his little brother, escaped from communist Poland all the way to Sweden.</p>
